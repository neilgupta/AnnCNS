# Ann CNS

Python code for Raspberry Pi to send data back and forth between sensors, server, and motors. Pretty straightforward.

To use, run this python script on your raspberry pi while connected to a xbee series 2 via USB. Adjust the four variables in the configuration section to match your needs/settings.

This project is used in conjunction with [Ann](https://github.com/neilgupta/Ann) and [SensorNeurons](https://github.com/neilgupta/SensorNeurons).
